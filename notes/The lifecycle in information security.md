Security is not a permanent state which, once achieved, will never change. 

- due to organisation changes, changes to external framework conditions or new attack methods or vulnerabilities being discovered
- security concepts or safeguards may partially or completely become inefficient
- ensure maintaining and improving reached level of security on a continuous basis

- after security safeguards have been implemented, they must be examined regularly to ensure they are: 
	-  effective
	- appropriate
	- applicable
	- actually being applied
