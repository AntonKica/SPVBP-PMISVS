- this model is also referred to as the PDCA cycle

- divided into the following phases in the literature:
1. planning
	- the framework conditions are identified and analysed
	- the security objectives are determined
	- security strategy is drawn up containing the basic statements on how the set objectives should be achieved
2. implementing the plan and carrying out the project,
	- [security strategy](<Security strategy>) is implemented with the help of the security concept and an appropriate security organisation structure
3. performance review and/or monitoring the achievement of objectives, and
	- regularly examining whether the framework conditions (e.g. laws, objectives of the organisation, or the environment) have changed 
	- regularly examining whether the security concept and organisation have proven to be effective and efficient
4. eliminating discovered flaws and vulnerabilities and making optimisations and improvements.

- different organisations have different initial conditions, security requirements, and
financial resources
- each organisation must define and specify individually the form of the lifecycle model that is appropriate for them
## remarks
- small government agencies and companies should not be put off by this
- the effort required for the security process generally depends on the size of the organisation

### In a very large company
- it is probably necessary to implement a rather formal process 
- defining what internal and external audits are needed, who should report to whom, who should draw up decision papers, and when the management should meet to discuss the security process.

### In a small company
- an annual meeting between the managing director and the IT service provider, might already be sufficient in order to critically examine the success of the security process
- they ought to discuss the problems experienced throughout the past year, the costs incurred, the latest technological developments, and other factors
