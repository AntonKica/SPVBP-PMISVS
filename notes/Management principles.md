Information security management or abbreviated IS management is the term referring to the planning, supervisory function and security safeguards. This assures:
- meaningful development,
- practical feasibility and
- effectiveness of a well thought-through and systematic security process

The processes of meeting and complying with statutory and regulatory requirement are also included.


## the less spectacular safeguards
- are the ones that improve the level of security in practice quite substantially
- some examples may include:
	- process optimisation
	- training and awareness-raising measures
	- staff motivation 
	- drawing up of comprehensible documentation

## complex and expensive safeguards
- large-scale projects, and investments in technology are frequently very wrongly portrayed as being more effective
- give poor reputation of security safeguards as a cost driver
