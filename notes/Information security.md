- the classical basic values of information security include confidentiality, integrity, and availability - CIA
- further generic umbrella terms in the field of information security, for example, include authenticity, reliability, reliableness, resilience, and non-repudiation

- overview of [BSI standards](<BSI publications and standards on information security>) and [ISO standards](<ISO standards on information security>) on information security
## IT security versus information security and cyber security
- distinguishing between whether information is processed using information technology, communications technology, or on paper is no longer up-to-date
- the term “information security” instead of "IT security" is more comprehensive and more appropriate
- it should be noted that the term “IT security” still is frequently used in the literature, even if “information security” often is what is meant
- the field of action of classical IT security is expanded to the entire cyberspace under the term “cyber security”
- cyber security includes the entire information technology connected to the Internet and comparable networks and also includes communications, applications, processes, and processed information based thereon
